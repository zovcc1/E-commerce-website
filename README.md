**E-Commerce Application**

This repository contains a modular, feature-based Java Spring Boot application designed to manage the core functionalities of an e-commerce platform. The application is divided into distinct modules, each responsible for a specific aspect of the platform, such as customer management, product catalog, order processing, and administrative tasks.

**Key Features:**
- **Feature-Based Structure:** Organized into separate modules for `admin`, `customer`, `order`, and `product`, each with its own controllers, services, models, and repositories, ensuring clean and maintainable code.
- **Separated Admin Module:** The admin functionalities are isolated into a dedicated module, enabling independent management of administrative operations such as user management, product management, and order oversight.
- **Security:** Integrated Spring Security with JWT for secure authentication, ensuring that only authenticated users can access protected resources.
- **RESTful API:** Provides a comprehensive set of RESTful endpoints for easy interaction with the front-end or other services.

**Technologies Used:**
- **Java 17**
- **Spring Boot**
- **Spring Security**
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**
- **JPA/Hibernate**
- **MySQL/PostgreSQL** (or any relational database)

This application serves as a robust foundation for building a fully-functional e-commerce platform, with a clear separation of concerns and a focus on security and scalability.
